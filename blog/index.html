        <aside>Posted at: May 9, 2016 by Julius Volz on behalf of the Prometheus core developers</aside>
        <article class="doc-content">
          <p>Since the inception of Prometheus, we have been looking for a sustainable
governance model for the project that is independent of any single company.
Recently, we have been in discussions with the newly formed <a href="https://cncf.io/">Cloud Native
Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF), which is backed by Google,
CoreOS, Docker, Weaveworks, Mesosphere, and <a href="https://cncf.io/about/members">other leading infrastructure
companies</a>.</p>

<p>Today, we are excited to announce that the CNCF's Technical Oversight Committee
<a href="http://lists.cncf.io/pipermail/cncf-toc/2016-May/000198.html">voted unanimously</a> to
accept Prometheus as a second hosted project after Kubernetes! You can find
more information about these plans in the
<a href="https://cncf.io/news/news/2016/05/cloud-native-computing-foundation-accepts-prometheus-second-hosted-project">official press release by the CNCF</a>.</p>

<p>By joining the CNCF, we hope to establish a clear and sustainable project
governance model, as well as benefit from the resources, infrastructure, and
advice that the independent foundation provides to its members.</p>

<p>We think that the CNCF and Prometheus are an ideal thematic match, as both
focus on bringing about a modern vision of the cloud.</p>

<p>In the following months, we will be working with the CNCF on finalizing the
project governance structure. We will report back when there are more details
to announce.</p>

        <aside>Posted at: May 8, 2016 by Björn “Beorn” Rabenstein</aside>
        <article class="doc-content">
          <p>The embedded time serie database (TSDB) of the Prometheus server organizes the
raw sample data of each time series in chunks of constant 1024 bytes size. In
addition to the raw sample data, a chunk contains some meta-data, which allows
the selection of a different encoding for each chunk. The most fundamental
distinction is the encoding version. You select the version for newly created
chunks via the command line flag <code>-storage.local.chunk-encoding-version</code>. Up to
now, there were only two supported versions: 0 for the original delta encoding,
and 1 for the improved double-delta encoding. With release
<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/0.18.0">0.18.0</a>, we
added version 2, which is another variety of double-delta encoding. We call it
<em>varbit encoding</em> because it involves a variable bit-width per sample within
the chunk. While version 1 is superior to version 0 in almost every aspect,
there is a real trade-off between version 1 and 2. This blog post will help you
to make that decision. Version 1 remains the default encoding, so if you want
to try out version 2 after reading this article, you have to select it
explicitly via the command line flag. There is no harm in switching back and
forth, but note that existing chunks will not change their encoding version
once they have been created. However, these chunks will gradually be phased out
according to the configured retention time and will thus be replaced by chunks
with the encoding specified in the command-line flag.</p>

          <p><em>This is the second in a series of interviews with users of Prometheus, allowing
them to share their experiences of evaluating and using Prometheus.</em></p>

</h2>

<p>I’m Antonin Kral, and I’m leading research and architecture for
<a href="http://www.showmax.com">ShowMax</a>. Before that, I’ve held architectural and CTO
roles for the past 12 years.</p>

<p>ShowMax is a subscription video on demand service that launched in South Africa
in 2015. We’ve got an extensive content catalogue with more than 20,000
episodes of TV shows and movies. Our service is currently available in 65
countries worldwide. While better known rivals are skirmishing in America and
Europe, ShowMax is battling a more difficult problem: how do you binge-watch
in a barely connected village in sub-Saharan Africa? Already 35% of video
around the world is streamed, but there are still so many places the revolution
has left untouched.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2016-05-01/showmax-logo-cba69076dfb.png" alt="ShowMax logo"></p>

<p>We are managing about 50 services running mostly on private clusters built
around CoreOS. They are primarily handling API requests from our clients
(Android, iOS, AppleTV, JavaScript, Samsung TV, LG TV etc), while some of them
are used internally. One of the biggest internal pipelines is video encoding
which can occupy 400+ physical servers when handling large ingestion batches.</p>

<p>The majority of our back-end services are written in Ruby, Go or Python. We use
EventMachine when writing apps in Ruby (Goliath on MRI, Puma on JRuby). Go is
typically used in apps that require large throughput and don’t have so much
business logic. We’re very happy with Falcon for services written in Python.
Data is stored in PostgreSQL and ElasticSearch clusters. We use etcd and custom
tooling for configuring Varnishes for routing requests.</p>

<a href="https://www.life360.com/">Life360</a>, and before that, I’ve held systems
engineering roles for the past 9 years.</p>

<p>Life360 creates technology that helps families stay connected, we’re the Family
Network app for families. We’re quite busy handling these families - at peak
we serve 700k requests per minute for 70 million registered families.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.life360.com/"><img src="/assets/blog/2016-03-23/life360_horizontal_logo_gradient_rgb-cbd96375a03.png" style="width: 444px; height:177px"></a></p>

<p>We manage around 20 services in production, mostly handling location requests
from mobile clients (Android, iOS, and Windows Phone), spanning over 150+
instances at peak. Redundancy and high-availability are our goals and we strive
to maintain 100% uptime whenever possible because families trust us to be
available.</p>

<p>We hold user data in both our MySQL multi-master cluster and in our 12-node
Cassandra ring which holds around 4TB of data at any given time. We have
services written in Go, Python, PHP, as well as plans to introduce Java to our
stack. We use Consul for service discovery, and of course our Prometheus setup
is integrated with it.</p>

        <aside>Posted at: March 3, 2016 by Fabian Reinartz</aside>
        <article class="doc-content">
          <p>The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by Prometheus servers and sends
notifications about them to different receivers based on their labels.</p>

<p>A receiver can be one of many different integrations such as PagerDuty, Slack,
email, or a custom integration via the generic webhook interface (for example <a href="https://github.com/fabxc/jiralerts">JIRA</a>).</p>

<h2 id="templates">Templates<a class="header-anchor" href="#templates" name="templates"></a>
</h2>

<p>The messages sent to receivers are constructed via templates.
Alertmanager comes with default templates but also allows defining custom
ones.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we will walk through a simple customization of Slack
notifications.</p>

<p>We use this simple Alertmanager configuartion that sends all alerts to Slack:</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">global:
  slack_api_url: '&lt;slack_webhook_url&gt;'

route:
  receiver: 'slack-notifications'
  # All alerts in a notification have the same value for these labels.
  group_by: [alertname, datacenter, app]

receivers:
- name: 'slack-notifications'
  slack_configs:
  - channel: '#alerts'
</code></pre>

<p>By default, a Slack message sent by Alertmanager looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2016-03-03/slack_alert_before-cb14b42b46d.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It shows us that there is one firing alert, followed by the label values of
the alert grouping (alertname, datacenter, app) and further label values the
alerts have in common (critical).</p>

<p>A year ago today, we officially announced Prometheus to the wider world. This
is a great opportunity for us to look back and share some of the wonderful
things that have happened to the project since then. But first, let's start at
the beginning.</p>

<p>Although we had already started Prometheus as an open-source project on GitHub in
2012, we didn't make noise about it at first. We wanted to give the project
time to mature and be able to experiment without friction. Prometheus was
gradually introduced for production monitoring at
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> in 2013 and then saw more and more
usage within the company, as well as some early adoption by our friends at
Docker and Boexever in 2014. Over the years, Prometheus was growing more and
more mature and although it was already solving people's monitoring problems,
it was still unknown to the wider public.</p>

        <article class="doc-content">
          <p>In a <a href="/blog/2015/06/01/advanced-service-discovery/">previous post</a> we
introduced numerous new ways of doing service discovery in Prometheus.
Since then a lot has happened. We improved the internal implementation and
received fantastic contributions from our community, adding support for
service discovery with Kubernetes and Marathon. They will become available
with the release of version 0.16.</p>

<p>We also touched on the topic of <a href="/blog/2015/06/01/advanced-service-discovery/#custom-service-discovery">custom service discovery</a>.</p>

<p>Not every type of service discovery is generic enough to be directly included
in Prometheus. Chances are your organisation has a proprietary
system in place and you just have to make it work with Prometheus.
This does not mean that you cannot enjoy the benefits of automatically
discovering new monitoring targets.</p>

<p>In this post we will implement a small utility program that connects a custom
service discovery approach based on <a href="https://coreos.com/etcd/">etcd</a>, the
highly consistent distributed key-value store, to Prometheus.</p>

          <p><em>Editor's note: This article is a guest post written by a Prometheus user.</em></p>

<p><strong>If you are operating the network for 10,000's of demanding gamers, you need to
really know what is going on inside your network. Oh, and everything needs to be
built from scratch in just five days.</strong></p>

<p>If you have never heard about <a href="http://www.dreamhack.se/">DreamHack</a> before, here
is the pitch: Bring 20,000 people together and have the majority of them bring
their own computer.  Mix in professional gaming (eSports), programming contests,
and live music concerts. The result is the world's largest festival dedicated
solely to everything digital.</p>

<p>To make such an event possible, there needs to be a lot of infrastructure in
place. Ordinary infrastructures of this size take months to build, but the crew
at DreamHack builds everything from scratch in just five days. This of course
includes stuff like configuring network switches, but also building the
electricity distribution, setting up stores for food and drinks, and even
building the actual tables.</p>

<p>The team that builds and operates everything related to the network is
officially called the Network team, but we usually refer to ourselves as <em>tech</em>
or <em>dhtech</em>. This post is going to focus on the work of dhtech and how we used
Prometheus during DreamHack Summer 2015 to try to kick our monitoring up another
notch.</p>

          <p>In his <em><a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2015/05/01/openlettertomonitoringproducts/">Open Letter To Monitoring/Metrics/Alerting Companies</a></em>,
John Allspaw asserts that attempting "to detect anomalies perfectly, at the right time, is not possible".</p>

<p>I have seen several attempts by talented engineers to build systems to
automatically detect and diagnose problems based on time series data. While it
is certainly possible to get a demonstration working, the data always turned
out to be too noisy to make this approach work for anything but the simplest of
real-world systems.</p>

<p>All hope is not lost though. There are many common anomalies which you can
detect and handle with custom-built rules. The Prometheus <a href="../../../../../docs/querying/basics/">query
language</a> gives you the tools to discover
these anomalies while avoiding false positives.</p>

        <article class="doc-content">
          <p>This week we released Prometheus v0.14.0 — a version with many long-awaited additions
and improvements.</p>

<p>On the user side, Prometheus now supports new service discovery mechanisms. In
addition to DNS-SRV records, it now supports <a href="https://www.consul.io">Consul</a>
out of the box, and a file-based interface allows you to connect your own
discovery mechanisms. Over time, we plan to add other common service discovery
mechanisms to Prometheus.</p>

<p>Aside from many smaller fixes and improvements, you can now also reload your configuration during
runtime by sending a <code>SIGHUP</code> to the Prometheus process. For a full list of changes, check the
<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0140--2015-06-01">changelog for this release</a>.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we will take a closer look at the built-in service discovery mechanisms and provide
some practical examples. As an additional resource, see
